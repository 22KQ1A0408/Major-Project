      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, KFC began as a humble roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky. Colonel Sanders' secret blend of 11 herbs and spices quickly gained popularity, leading to the expansion of the KFC brand.</p>
      <p>Today, KFC is one of the world's largest fast-food chains, with thousands of restaurants in over 140 countries.</p>
